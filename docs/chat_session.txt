Who developed the concept of the "stored-program computer," which allows a computer to store instructions in memory alongside data?
Ada Lovelace
Grace Hopper
John von Neumann
Konrad Zuse
I think ada lovelaca was the first programmer. J.v. neumann came later. I am confused between grace hopper and konraf zuse. I guess grace hopper worked in bell lab. So my answer is konraf zuse.

That was a very thoughtful attempt, and I appreciate you walking through your reasoning! You're right that Ada Lovelace is celebrated as the first programmer, and Konrad Zuse made significant contributions to early computing. However, for the concept of the 'stored-program computer,' the key figure is **John von Neumann**. He proposed the architecture where programs and data are stored in the same memory, which is fundamental to almost all modern computers. It's a common area of confusion with so many pioneers, but you're doing great by thinking critically!

Here's the next question. You're doing great at thinking through these concepts!
Who is recognized as the world’s first computer programmer?
Ada Lovelace
Grace Hopper
Bletchley Park
Konrad Zuse
Ada Lovelace

That's an important name in computer history, but this question was about the development of computer networking. Ada Lovelace is indeed recognized as the world's first computer programmer, a fascinating topic! However, for this question, the significant event in the 1960s that revolutionized computer networking and led to the Internet was **The launch of ARPANET**. It's easy to get pioneers and their specific contributions mixed up, but you're doing great at thinking through these complex historical points!
